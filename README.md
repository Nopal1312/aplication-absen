An employee attendance web application featuring name cards with barcodes is designed to streamline the attendance recording process. Each employee will have a unique name card, and the use of barcodes or QR codes simplifies and speeds up the attendance process, enhancing efficiency and data accuracy. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of this system:
Features of Name Cards with Barcodes
Unique Identification: Each employee will have a name card equipped with a unique barcode or QR code. This helps in quickly and efficiently identifying employees.

Easy Attendance Process: Employees simply need to scan the barcode using a smartphone or a designated scanning device. Once scanned, the system automatically records their attendance time.

Absence Only Validity: The barcode on the name card is specifically for attendance purposes, reducing the likelihood of misuse, such as proxy attendance.

Benefits of Using This System
Time Efficiency: The attendance process becomes faster as employees no longer need to manually write their names and attendance times.

Data Accuracy: With the scanning system, errors in attendance recording can be minimized, resulting in more accurate data.

Better Data Management: Attendance data can be accessed in real-time and exported into easily manageable formats, such as Excel.

System Implementation
QR Code Setup: QR codes can be generated in bulk and printed on employee name cards. You can use online services to easily create QR codes.

Integration with HRIS: This attendance system can be integrated with existing HRIS software, such as Mekari Talenta, for more comprehensive employee data management.

Employee Training: Employees should receive brief training on how to use the name cards and scan the barcodes for attendance.

By implementing this system, companies can enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of employee attendance management while providing a better experience for employees in the attendance recording process.
